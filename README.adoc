= ASF Roadshow - FlexJS Introduction

== Usage

Build the slides using Maven

 $ mvn

Open the file _target/generated-slides/slides.html_ in your browser to see the generated HTML file containing the presentation deck.

== Remarks

In order to generate the diagrams, GraphVIS needs to be installed locally. Get it from: http://www.graphviz.org/

The template is adjusted to use the codecentric font Panton, so be sure to have that installed on your presentation machine.
Any css adjustments can go to "src/main/theme/cc.css" as this is automatically embedded into the themes directory.
